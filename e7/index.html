    <h1>Seven Principles of Typographic Contrast</h1>

    <p>In a seminal booklet that he both designed and wrote, Carl Dair showed how in typography, as in music, harmony and contrast are the keys to composition.

    <p>Written by John D. Berry</p>

    <p>The late Canadian typographer Carl Dair was one of the great typographic designers of the 1950s and 1960s, and he may have been the best of them all at
      explaining the nature of typography. In coordinated projects that he both wrote and designed, he managed to describe -- and show -- the ways in which
      manipulating and using type make typography happen.</p>
    <p>Dair is the very epitome of what I mean when I say "typographer": someone who designs with type, not just a fancy typesetter, but someone who uses type,
      in all its variations, as the principle element of design. Since type carries meaning, the practice of typography requires a designer who cares about the
      words themselves. It requires someone who cares enough, and is skillful enough, to make the type express that meaning, rather than serve as simply
      eye-catching decoration.</p>
