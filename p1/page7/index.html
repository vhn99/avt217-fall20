      <h2> Virgo: Jewel Tones</h2>
      <p>"Jewel tones for the Virgos," the Twins say.</p>
      <p>Members of the sign might find themselves drawn to colors like sapphire, emerald, ruby, and amethyst-rich darker tones that still have some brightness to them.</p>
      <p>They also like all white, natural fabrics, and forest greens.</p>
